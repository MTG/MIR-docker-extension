# MIR-docker-extension

## Introduction
This is a docker image that extends the [MIR-toolbox-docker](https://github.com/MTG/MIR-toolbox-docker)
docker image. The MIR-toolbox-docker image runs an ipython notebook server with [this dependencies](https://github.com/MTG/MIR-toolbox-docker)
plus MTG's [essentia library](http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/).

We provide in here a way of to facilitate extending the base image with new requirements.

## Installation
It is recommended to read the documentation about [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### Install docker
#### Windows
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

#### Mac
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

#### Ubuntu
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce

### Install docker-compose
Follow [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Run
First run the following command:

    docker-compose up

Then access localhost:8888 on your browser and when asked for a password use _mir_

## Add new requirements
You can install new dependencies on the docker image by adding the command you need on the Dockerfile prefixed by 'RUN'.
As an example, if you would like to install python3 setuptools you would have to add the following at the end of the Dockerfile:

    RUN apt-get install -y python3-setuptools
    
As a helper, we already provide a requirements.txt file which can be used to install most python packages, just add the package name to the file. Keep in mind that the _pip install -r requirements.txt_ command does not install the packages in order.

Once you added a new dependency, you can re-build and run the image like:

    docker-compose up --build

## Data
Take into consideration that the docker container created by the _docker-compose up_ command will
only be able to access the directories on your machine that are specified on the _volumes_
instruction of the _docker-compose.yml_ file.

With the configuration we provide in here the working directory ('.') is mounted in the
docker container on _/home/ds/notebooks_.

If you want to mount a different directory, for instance _/home/user/data_, modify the volumes section of the
docker_compose.yml file like:

```
    volumes:
     - /home/user/data:/home/ds/notebooks
```
